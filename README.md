## Introduction

keys.pub is a [library](/docs/lib/), [command line utility](/docs/cli/) and [desktop app](/docs/desktop/install.md) that manages cryptographic keys, sigchains and user identities.

```shell
> keys pull gabriel@github
kex1mnseg28xu6g3j4wur7hqwk8ag3fu3pmr2t5lync26xmgff0dtryqupf80c

> echo "hi ðŸ¤“" | keys encrypt -armor -recipient gabriel@github
BEGIN SALTPACK ENCRYPTED MESSAGE. kcJn5brvybfNjz6 D5ll2Nk0Z2co0as ...
```

(The above example pulls the public key for the Github user gabriel, verifies it and creates an encrypted message.)

The default key is a [Curve25519 key (EdX25519)](/docs/specs/keys.md) capable of signing and encryption.
Using this key, you can create a [sigchain](/docs/specs/sigchain.md) (an ordered sequence of signed statements).
You can [link a key to an identity](/docs/specs/user.md) (on Github, Twitter, Reddit, etc), by publishing a signed statement in your sigchain.

You can [search for keys](/docs/restapi/user.md#get-user-search) by user name and service, or [lookup a user](/docs/restapi/user.md#get-user-kid) by a key identifier using a [REST API](/docs/restapi/).

[Key identifiers](/docs/specs/kid.md) are [Bech32 format](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki), encode the type of key and public key bytes, and include a checksum with error correction.

The [Saltpack](https://saltpack.org) format is used for signing and encryption, providing authenticity, repudability and anonymity. (Saltpack uses nacl.box and nacl.secretbox constructions.)

Your keys are protected by a [keyring](docs/specs/keyring.md) which is secured by both the OS and a user supplied password (similar to a password manager).

The `keysd` daemon runs as a [gRPC service](/docs/service.md) on your computer.

### Similarities/Differences

- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/docs): This project borrows many ideas from Keybase, including sigchains and user (proofs), and uses [Saltpack](https://saltpack.org) and [keybase/go-keychain](https://github.com/keybase/go-keychain) and other packages.
  However, this project only provides a 1-to-1 association of a key to a user.
- [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age): We also use Bech32 as a key identifiers, and [convert Ed25519 keys to X25519](https://blog.filippo.io/using-ed25519-keys-for-encryption/).
